        &nbsp;Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s completely normal and a healthy sign that you&apos;re growing and becoming a better programmer. 
Though it&apos;s a gratifying journey, not all suffering is justified, sometimes we just want an easy way to find a solution for a bug or a complete understandable explanation on how to make a certain program.<br /><br />

&nbsp;That&apos;s what we&apos;re here for! We want to make your life easy way and grow as a community. None of us are expert programmers, but we all put ourselves out there everyday to someday be there, do you wanna join us?</div>
